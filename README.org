This is the combination of two enjoyable things: LaTeX and espresso
drinks.

The file ~espresso.tex~ in this repository will produce an A4-sized
"poster" with pictures of 12 different espresso drinks.

The generation of the poster requires PDFLaTeX and TikZ and a few
other common packages.  An up-to-date TeXLive installation should have
everything needed.
